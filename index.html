  <h1>The Lion and the Cat</h1>
  <p>Once in the heart of the savanna, a mighty lion rested beneath the shade of an acacia tree.</p>
  <p>A small stray cat approached with no fear, curious and clever.</p>
  <p>The lion growled, but the cat spoke, “I may be small, but I carry wisdom the jungle forgets.”</p>
  <p>Intrigued, the lion listened. They spoke for hours — about hunting, patience, and survival.</p>
  <p>From that day forward, the lion and the cat met every week, exchanging tales. Strength met strategy.</p>
  <p>In the wild, sometimes wisdom walks on tiny paws.</p>
